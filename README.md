## Hi I'm HyperQTQ!
I'm a programmer from Estonia who likes metal and stuff.
Did some competitive programming in high school, currently trying to complete some personal projects.
- Learning SwiftUI, C++, AR development.
- Will gladly help with any open-source projects, just send me a DM on discord(binaryindexedtree) :).
